Conduct market research on the following topic:

**Research Topic:** {topic}

{additional_instructions}

## Your Plan

**Step 1 — Research (do this FIRST, aim for 6-10 tool calls total):**
- 2-3 searches on market size, segments, and landscape
- 2-3 searches on key players, competitors, and market share
- 1-2 searches on analyst reports and expert perspectives
- 1-2 searches on trends, outlook, and risks
- Use WebFetch on 2-3 of the most important pages for detailed data
- HARD LIMIT: After 10 tool calls, STOP immediately and start writing

**Step 2 — Write the report (this is the MOST IMPORTANT step):**
- Write the COMPLETE Markdown report in a SINGLE message
- Start directly with: # {topic}: Executive Market Research Brief
- Follow the exact section structure from your instructions
- Target 2500-3500 words (8-10 PDF pages) — this must be a substantial report
- End with the References section listing ALL URLs consulted

CRITICAL: The report is the deliverable — not the research. A complete, well-written 8-page report with 6 good sources is FAR better than endless searching that produces no report. After your research searches, you MUST write the full report.
